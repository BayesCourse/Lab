========================================================

Question 1
---

The equations are independent, so the joint probability is the multiplication of the individual probabilities.

\[
\frac{2}{x^3} \frac{3}{y^4}
\]

Question Two
--------

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
require(reshape)
require(ggplot2)
#Define Functions

gx<-function(x){
  2/(x^3)
}

hy<-function(y){
  3/y^4
}

#plot functions
s<-seq(1,2,0.01)

r<-data.frame(s,g=gx(s),h=hy(s))
r<-melt(r,id.var="s")

ggplot(r,aes(x=s,y=value,col=variable)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
```

Verbal explanation of question two answer: We want to know the area under the pdf for x from 1 to y, where y is evaluated from 1 to infinity. This is a double integral in the form of 

\[ \int_1^{+\infty} \int_1^y \frac{2}{x^3} \frac{3}{y^4}
\,dx.\,dy.\] 

after some fancy algebra that it took me far too long to understand (see attached):

\[ \int_1^{+\infty} \frac{-3*y^-5}{5} +  \int_1^{+\infty} \frac{-3y^-3*}{3}
\,dx.\,dy.\] 


remembering that lim of y as approaches Inf = 0 for any negative polynomial, we can find that we just need to evaluate at 1 for each and add the results, which is: 

\[ \frac{-3}{5} + 1 = \frac{2}{5}\]

hurrah!
alot of credit to marisa and elise for sticking it out with me.
