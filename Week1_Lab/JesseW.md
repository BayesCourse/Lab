# Lab 1

### Question 1

X and Y are **independent** variables with the following probability distributions:   $g(x)=\frac{2}{x^3}$ for 1 < x < infinity and   $h(y)=\frac{3}{y^4}$ for 1 < y < infinity.    
What is their joint probability?  
Because the two variables are independent, their joint probability is simply the product of the two individual probabilities. This is shown as $P(X,Y)=\frac{6}{x^3y^4}$  

### Question 2

Show that $P(X<Y)=\frac{2}{5}$:


```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist    
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 43  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120
```
